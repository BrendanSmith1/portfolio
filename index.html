    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      I’m a passionate web developer who left a successful career as a quantity surveyor to pursue my true passion for problem-solving
      through software engineering. After spending over two years in quantity surveying, I realized that I wanted to channel my
      analytical skills into something more creative and dynamic. This led me to complete an intensive web development bootcamp
      at Le Wagon, where I gained a solid foundation in full-stack development, mastering technologies like Ruby on Rails,
      JavaScript, and React. Since then, I’ve worked on various projects which you can take a look at below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my technical skills I also bring lots of soft skills which I’ve gained from my previous roles in management and from my solo travels through
      Southeast Asia. During my time in quantity surveying, I was responsible for managing budgets, teams, and timelines,
      all of which required a high level of communication, leadership, and organization. I learned how to work with diverse groups,
      make decisions under pressure, and keep projects on track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, solo traveling around Southeast Asia sharpened my adaptability and problem-solving abilities.
      Navigating unfamiliar environments, overcoming language barriers, and managing unexpected challenges on my own gave me
      resilience and resourcefulness. These experiences taught me how to thrive in uncertainty, embrace challenges, and approach
      new situations with a positive mindset — qualities that help me to integrate in to new teams easily.
